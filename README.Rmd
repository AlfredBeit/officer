## officer

The officer package provides lets R users manipulate Word (`.docx`) and PowerPoint (`*.pptx`) documents. 

> This package is close to ReporteRs as it produces Word and PowerPoint files but it is faster, do not require `rJava` (but `xml2`) and has less functions that will make it easier to maintain.

A *cursor* concept has been implemented to make it easier the post processing of files. In a Word document, one can 
use the cursor to reach a particular paragraph containing a given text, or the beginning of the document and the end. 
In a PowerPoint document, one can set a slide as selected and reach a particular shape (and remove it or add text). 

The package [flextable](https://github.com/davidgohel/flextable) brings a full API to produce nice tables and use them with `officer`.

### Installation
